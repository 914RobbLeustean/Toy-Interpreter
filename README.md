# Toy-Interpreter

A lightweight toy language interpreter written in Java, built as a proof-of-concept for compiler construction fundamentals. This project demonstrates key techniques including lexical analysis, recursive descent parsing, and AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) generation. Utilizing the interpreter and visitor design patterns, it dynamically evaluates expressions and language constructs. Ideal for those looking to explore language processing and interpreter design in a modular, educational framework.
